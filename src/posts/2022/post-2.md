<!-- Excerpt Start -->
There has certainly been a lot going on in my life this year and the past few weeks have been no exception. I am trying to squeeze in some time to work on my website between job hours and dealing with other life-related responsibilities. Today I managed to rewrite some major changes to the design layout.
<!-- Excerpt End -->

The initial design layout of the site was just throwing out something to see if I could get everything working. It wasn't really following responsive design principles so I went back to the drawing board for something that works better for all devices. The code is a mess but I'll improve, clean and refactor everything when I have more time. I also need to add some sort of tag search so readers can have an easier time looking for posts they actually want to read.
