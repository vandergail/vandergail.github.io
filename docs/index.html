    <p>Hi. Quite a few seasons have passed since I have updated this webpage and published new posts. For this reason, I have decided to redesign it from the ground up and remove the handful of existing posts. My intention is to theme the design based on retro computing aesthetics. My first computer was a variant of a Compaq Deskpro running MS-DOS thus the look and feel of IBM PC DOS is reflective of my personal history.</p>
<p>Regarding future posts, my expectations are to share my thoughts on a few interests:</p>
